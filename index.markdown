## Hi!

My name ist Jari Pronold, I am a PhD student in computational neuroscience at [INM-6](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-6/EN/Home/home_node_INM6.html). My research deals with large scale computational models of human and macaque cortices as well as simulator technologies ([NEST](https://github.com/nest/nest-private)) enabling such simulations.
Before becoming a neuroscientist, I used to work in plasma physics.


In my leisure time I enjoy playing bass in my band [Dystopera](https://www.facebook.com/dystoperamusic/).
